A simple ToDoList app was created for the Mobile Application course (Assignment 2 for CSE464). This app was built without using SQLite and demonstrates basic Android UI components and event handling.

1. Linear Layout: Used as the main layout in the XML file for a structured arrangement of UI elements.
2. ListView: Displays the list of items added by the user.
3. EditText: Allows the user to input new items for the list.
4. Button: Adds the entered item to the list when clicked.
5. Long Press to Delete: Allows the user to delete any item from the list by performing a long press on the item.

Here's the video that represents the functionality of the project:
